## Privacy

Snap Data Explorer is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **100% Local** — All data processing happens on your machine
- **No Network Access** — The app makes zero network requests
- **No Telemetry** — No analytics, tracking, or data collection of any kind
- **No Cloud** — Your data is stored in a local SQLite database
- **Open Source** — Inspect every line of code yourself

Your processed data is stored locally at:

| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/com.kody.snap-data-explorer-app/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/com.kody.snap-data-explorer-app/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/com.kody.snap-data-explorer-app/` |
